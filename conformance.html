        <a name="textlevelsemantics"></a>
        <h3>4.5 - Text-level Semantics</h3>
		<p>The tag <code>rb</code> came up as an error on the validation site. All other tags
		worked on all browsers as expected.</p>
        
        <a name="edits"></a>
        <h3>4.6 - Edits</h3>
		<p>No problems detected. Worked on all browsers</p>
        
        <a name="embeddedcontent"></a>
        <h3>4.7 - Embedded Content</h3>
        <p>Chrome, Firefox, and IE all displayed resized images differently.
        Resized images in IE look harsh a crispy, while resized images in Chrome and Firefox look smooth.
        Resized images in Firefox look a bit more blurry than in Chrome.</p>
        <p>All three browsers displays the alt text when there is an image with a bad src. Chrome displays a
        rectangle with the alt text inside. Firefox only displays the alt text. IE displays a tiny rectangle
        with an "X" in the middle and then the alt text to the right of the tiny rectangle.</p>
        <p>All three browsers displays iframes similarly with slight color differences. The most noticeable
        difference is the different scrollbar used by the iframe in all three browsers.</p>
        <p>The math element does not work on Chrome or IE, but Firefox is able to display the mathematical notation described by the math element. </p>
        <p>Shapes created by the svg element are displayed the same way in Chrome and Firefox. IE displays
        shapes least elegantly. Borders around the shapes are thicker than in Chrome and Firefox. In IE, 
        it is also possible for shapes to overlap surrounding elements or text.</p>
        <p>The embed element works in Chrome, but Firefox and IE does not appear to be displaying media files embedded
        with the embed element. It is possible that the issue is due to a missing plugin.</p>
        <p>An HTML page embedded using the object element look similar in Chrome, Firefox, IE with the only
        difference being the scrollbar.</p>
        <p>Videos and sound embedded with the video and audio elements work in all three browsers. The difference is
        that all three have different controls.</p>
		<p>The track element does not appear to be working in Chrome. It correctly displays subtitles in embedded media in Firefox and IE, but not in Chrome.</p>
        
        <a name="links"></a>
        <h3>4.8 - Links</h3>
		<p>Links seem to be behaving the same in all three browsers.</p>
        
        <a name="tabulardata"></a>
        <h3>4.9 - Tabular Data</h3>
        <p>Although, datalist does work on Firefox and Internet Explorer it does not work as user friendly as it does on Chrome. In the input box there is not a down arrow that shows it has datalist, but it seems that it is just a normal text box.</p>
        
        
        <a name="forms"></a>
        <h3>4.10 - Forms</h3>
        <p>Keygen works fine on both Firefox and Chrome, but it does not work on Internet Explorer</p>
        <p>Output also works fine on both Firefox and Chrome, but it does not work on Internet Explorer</p>
        <p>Meter does not work on Internet Explorer</p>
