        <p>Although, datalist does work on Firefox and Internet Explorer it does not work as user friendly as it does on Chrome. In the input box there is not a down arrow that shows it has datalist, but it seems that it is just a normal text box.</p>
        <p>Keygen works fine on both Firefox and Chrome, but it does not work on Internet Explorer</p>
        <p>Output also works fine on both Firefox and Chrome, but it does not work on Internet Explorer</p>
